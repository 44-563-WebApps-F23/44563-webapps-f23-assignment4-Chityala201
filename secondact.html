    <h5 class="mrs-lindecls">MRS LINDE. </h5>
    <p class="speech">You must not forget that I had a helpless mother and two little
        brothers. We couldn’t wait for you, Nils; your prospects seemed
        hopeless then.</p>

    <h5 class="dr-krogstad">KROGSTAD. </h5>
    <p class="speech">That may be so, but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else’s
        sake.</p>

    <h5 class="mrs-linde">MRS LINDE. </h5>
    <p class="speech"> Indeed I don’t know. Many a time did I ask myself if I had the right to
        do it.</p>

    <h5 class="dr-krogstad">KROGSTAD. </h5>
    <p class="speech">
        <p class="direction">_[more gently]_.</p>
         When I lost you, it was as if all the solid ground
        went from under my feet. Look at me now—I am a shipwrecked man clinging
        to a bit of wreckage.</p>

    <h5 class="mrs-lindecls">MRS LINDE. </h5>
    <p class="speech">But help may be near.</p>

    <h5 class="dr-krogstad">KROGSTAD. </h5>
    <p class="speech"> It was near; but then you came and stood in my way.</p>

    <h5 class="mrs-linde">MRS LINDE. </h5>
    <p class="speech">Unintentionally, Nils. It was only today that I learned it was your
        place I was going to take in the Bank.</p>

    <h5 class="dr-krogstad">KROGSTAD. </h5>
    <p class="speech"> I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not
        going to give it up to me?</p>

    <h5 class="mrs-linde">MRS LINDE. </h5>
    <p class="speech">No, because that would not benefit you in the least.</p>
