MRS LINDE.
Now, Nils, let us have a talk.

KROGSTAD.
Can we two have anything to talk about?

MRS LINDE.
We have a great deal to talk about.

KROGSTAD.
I shouldn’t have thought so.

MRS LINDE.
No, you have never properly understood me.

KROGSTAD.
Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all
the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance
turns up?

MRS LINDE.
Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you
believe that I did it with a light heart?

KROGSTAD.
Didn’t you?

MRS LINDE.
Nils, did you really think that?
