    <h5>MRS LINDE. </h5> <p>Now, Nils, let us have a talk.</p>

    <h5>KROGSTAD. </h5> <p>Can we two have anything to talk about?</p>

    <h5>MRS LINDE. </h5> <p> We have a great deal to talk about.</p>

    <h5>KROGSTAD. </h5><p>I shouldn’t have thought so.</p>

    <h5>MRS LINDE. </h5><p>No, you have never properly understood me.</p>

    <h5>KROGSTAD. </h5><p> Was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all
        the world—a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance
        turns up?</p>

    <h5>MRS LINDE. </h5><p>Do you believe I am as absolutely heartless as all that? And do you
        believe that I did it with a light heart?</p>

    <h5>KROGSTAD. </h5><p> Didn’t you?</p>

    <h5>MRS LINDE. </h5><p>Nils, did you really think that?</p>
